[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://social-filter.streamlit.app)

This streamlit app is powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 Davinci model and is designed to detect inappropriate language, including hate speech, offensive language, and other forms of online abuse. The app aims to promote safe and respectful online communication, while also empowering users to take responsibility for the content they post online.

# Installation üí•

To run this application, you need to have Python 3.7+ installed on your machine. Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository and install the required packages by running:

- Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/cliffordsepato/Social-Filter-APP.git`
- Navigate to the project directory:`cd <your-repo>`
- Install the required dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Additional steps

1. Open a text editor or code editor on your local machine.

2. Create a new file and save it as ".env" in your project directory.

3. Add the following line to the file, replacing "your_api_key_here" with your actual API key:`OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

4. Save the file.

Once you have created the .env file, you can load the API key into your app by importing the os module and using the os.getenv() function to read the value of the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable. Here is an example:


```
import os
import openai

# load environment variable
load_dotenv()

# Load the API key from the environment variable
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```
